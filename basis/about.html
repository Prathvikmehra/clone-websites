        <div class="right">
            <p>Basis is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit applied research organization with two mutually reinforcing goals.</p>
            <p>The first is to understand and build intelligence. This means to establish the mathematical principles of
                what it means to reason, to learn, to make decisions, to understand, and to explain; and to construct
                software that implements these principles.</p>
            <p>The second is to advance society’s ability to solve intractable problems. This means expanding the scale,
                complexity, and breadth of problems that we can solve today, and even more importantly, accelerating our
                ability to solve problems in the future.</p>
            <p>To achieve these goals, we’re building both a new technological foundation that draws inspiration from
                how humans reason, and a new kind of collaborative organization that puts human values first.</p>
